## Stakeholders

See instructions. Delete this line and replace with the name(s) of the stakeholder(s) you interviewed and lists showing their goals/needs, and problems/frustrations.

### [George Escowitz] - Snow Equipment Lender
**Goals**
- Wants to be able to have data regarding the people they lend equipment to (Address, phone number, full name, etc).
- Wants a way to post a list of equipment they could lend out, with details like equipment serial number and date of purchase.
- Would like to be able to track history of rent they earned over time.
- Wants to be able to establish a detailed rental agreement and a way to keep track of them.
- Wants to be able to keep track of received payments through notifications and records (How, where, and when it was paid).
- Needs a way to flag customers and differentiate ones with bad history.


**Frustrations**
- As someone who owns equipment, lending out of goodwill often leads to damages that aren't financially compensated.
- Snow equipment sits in garage unused for most of the year, despite it being a large investment.
- Purchased snow equipment often becomes technologically outclassed in only a couple of years.
- Depreciation over time makes reselling equipment difficult, so its hard to make back money from already purchased equipment. In addition, since it depreciates over time even without usage, there is an incentive to put it to any use whenever possible.

### [Chandhini Ramaiah] - Snow Equipment Renter
**Goals**
- Quick access to snow removal equipment when it snows.
- Access to affordable snow removal equipment.
- Wants to feel safe and protected when renting tools from strangers.
- App is easy to use for those who aren't tech savvy.
- The equipment is of good quality and will not break.


**Frustrations**
- Traditional snow shoveling is physically taxing and sometimes dangerous, especially as an older adult.
- Apps are often confusing and difficult to use as an older adult.
- Snow does not occur year round. It is not financially worth it to purchase expensive snow removal equipment that will only be used a handful of times a year.
- During peak snow seasons, snow removal equipment is hard to obtain in immediate situations.
- It is uncomfortable asking neighbors to borrow their snow equipment, especially during times when the neighbors also need to use it. 



### [Emily Bigio] - App Administrator
**Goals**
- Ensure the platform is safe and secure for all users, including fraud and theft prevention.
- Be able to quickly resolve customer complaints, ensuring customer service has a quick turnaround.
- Be able to moderate all content on the app, ensuring that posts/users are appropriate and valid.
- Be able to see whats happening and critical on the entire platform quickly via an easy-to-read dashboard.


**Frustrations**
- All online retailers experience fraudulent user activity. As an example, some users may post products they do not have. If these fraudulent users are not caught quickly, there can be serious repercussions.
- Sometimes, there are many customer service inquiries at a time which leads to a long turnaround. Customers also get frustrated by this.
- When an admin platform is complicated, it is difficult to spot critical vulnerabilities quickly. This decreases the security of the platform.
- Customer service disputes are difficult to resolve without proper proof.
