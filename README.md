- Wants to feel safe and protected when renting tools from strangers.
- App is easy to use for those who aren't tech savvy.

**Frustrations**

- Apps are often confusing and difficult to use as an older adult.

- Is uncomfortable asking neighbors to borrow their snow equipment, especially during times when the neighbors also need to use it.
