### [NAME] - Snow Equipment Lender

### [Chandhini Ramaiah] - Snow Equipment Renter
**Goals**
- Quick access to snow removal equipment when it snows.
- Access to affordable snow removal equipment.
- Wants to feel safe and protected when renting tools from strangers.
- App is easy to use for those who aren't tech savvy.
- The equipment is of good quality and will not break.


**Frustrations**
- Traditional snow shoveling is physically taxing and sometimes dangerous, especially as an older adult.
- Apps are often confusing and difficult to use as an older adult.
- Snow does not occur year round. It is not financially worth it to purchase expensive snow removal equipment that will only be used a handful of times a year.
- During peak snow seasons, snow removal equipment is hard to obtain in immediate situations.
- Is uncomfortable asking neighbors to borrow their snow equipment, especially during times when the neighbors also need to use it.
